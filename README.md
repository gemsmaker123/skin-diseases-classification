Skin Diseases Classification Project
Dataset

This project uses the Skin Diseases Image Dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailpromus/skin-diseases-image-dataset

The dataset includes images of the following skin diseases:

Eczema – 1,677 images

Melanoma – 15,750 images

Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) – 3,323 images

Melanocytic Nevi (NV) – 7,970 images

Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors – 1,800 images

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify skin disease images using deep learning models. Three main approaches were used:

Custom CNN

Used for binary classification between Melanoma and Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC).

EfficientNet

Used for binary classification to differentiate skin diseases (cancer vs benign).

Also used for multi-class classification among all five skin disease types listed above.
